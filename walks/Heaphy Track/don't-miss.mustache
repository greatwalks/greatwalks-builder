        Get on your bike! Mountain biking is being trialled on the Heaphy Track until 
        September 2013. It takes 2 - 3 days to ride. Riding from Aorere
        to Karamea is the most popular route.

        Kahurangi National Park harbours half of New Zealandâ€™s 40 species of powelliphanta 
        (carnivorous land snail.) Look out for one on the track,
        particularly near limestone outcrops where there is enough calcium to nourish
        their sizeable shells!

      <li>Fantastic flora! See
          huge podocarps and giant northern r&#257;t&#257; in the lowland forest, a huge
          variety of alpine and subalpine species on the Gouland Downs and karaka, ngaio
          and n&#299;kau palms in the coastal forest.

        The Heaphy Hut is located right next to one of New
        Zealand&rsquo;s oldest and most interesting archaeological sites &ndash; an
        ancient village situated on a nearby river bank, believed to have been settled by
        Polynesians in the 13th - 14th century.

        Kahurangi National Park is home to an abundance of native
        birds. Weka, t&#363;&#299;, kerer&#363;; kea and k&#257;k&#257; can be found
        along the way. With a bit of luck you might see, or at least hear, the great
        spotted kiwi and morepork.
