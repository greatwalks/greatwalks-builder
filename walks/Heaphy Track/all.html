      You can walk the Heaphy Track all year. The most popular period is during the
      summer from Christmas through to Easter (December - April), however walking the
      track in autumn can be good option as there are fewer people on the track and the
      weather is often calm and settled. Mountain biking is permitted on the Heaphy Track
      during the off peak season only, from 1 May to 30 September, until 30 September
      2013.

    <p class="c4">
      For those with limited time or families with young children we recommend
      completing a day walk or staying overnight at a hut to experience some of the track
      and spend time exploring. A popular2 day, 1 night
      trip starting from the western side of the track is from Kohaihai to
      Heaphy Hut, returning to Kohaihai. The longest of the Great Walks at 78.4 km, to
      walk the whole of the Heaphy Track you will need to be fit and have good equipment.
      We recommend that walkers start a fitness programme at least two months before
      departure and practise carrying a full pack (15 kg) up and down stairs or hills.
      For a 4 day trip you can expect to walk up to 24 km per day or 21 km per day for a
      5 day trip.

      From Brown Hut to Aorere Shelter the track climbs gradually. From here, the
      Aorere valley is seen extending northwards and on clear days it is possible to see
      Mt Taranaki / Egmont. 30 mins before reaching Perry Saddle Hut, 880 m above sea
      level, a short track leads to a viewpoint at Flanagans Corner. At 915 m above sea

      Passing through tussock clearings and patches of beech trees this track
      crosses one of several limestone arches which are the remnants of old caves.

      Day 3: Gouland Downs Hut to Saxon Hut
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      1.5 hours, 5.4 km / 3 mi
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      Relatively level as it crosses the northern part of Gouland Downs, the
      tussock country and riverbeds make it great for exploring. Be careful when the mist
      lowers as the features can be confusing and it is easy to become
      disoriented.

      Day 4: Saxon Hut to James Mackay Hut

      Dropping slightly to grassy flats beside the Saxton River, a section of this
      track can flood. In wet conditions this can be potentially dangerous, and
      walkers should wait for the water to recede before continuing.

      Day 5: James Mackay Hut to Lewis Hut

      The track soon leads into the richer and taller forest typical of the West
      Coast. Glimpses of the Heaphy River can be spotted along the way. Be sure to apply
      the insect repellent as this is where the sand flies start to appear!

      Day 6: Lewis Hut to Kohaihai

    <p class="c4">
      7.5 hours, 24.2 km / 15 mi

      The track crosses the Heaphy River and continues through a forest of native
      kahikatea, rimu and rata. Be sure to listen out for the wildlife. The river mouth
      is at the junction of two pounamu (greenstone) trails with archaeological evidence
      that occupation from Maori extends back 500 years. At the Heaphy River mouth the
      river surges out through a narrow gap into the sea; the churning of fresh water
      with the sea water is spectacular! Crossing at Crayfish (Koura) Point can be
      impassable two hours either side of the high tide mark when conditions are rough.
      Check the tide timetable before you leave the hut.
