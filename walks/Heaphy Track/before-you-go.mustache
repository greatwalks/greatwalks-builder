      Heaphy
      Track safety
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        
          Weather on the Heaphy
          Track is changeable with annual rainfall averaging over 4000 mm. Heavy rain can
          occur with little warning and even small streams are dangerous in flood. Be
          prepared for rain, snow and wind especially on the exposed sections of the
          track.
        
      </li>
      <li>
        
          Most major streams are
          bridged, but at Crayfish (Koura) Point the route can be impassable two hours
          either side of high tide when sea conditions are rough. Ensure you check the
          tide timetable when planning your trip.
        
      </li>
      <li>
        
          Sand flies can be
          present during your walk. It is recommended you take insect repellent.
        
      </li>
      <li>
        During winter, adverse
          weather can change the track significantly. These will be marked by signage and
          warning tape although you may want to check with the <a href="http://www.doc.govt.nz/footer-links/contact-us/visitor-centres/#nelson">

    <h3>
      When to go
    </h3>
    <p>
      You can walk the Heaphy Track all year. The most popular period is during the
      summer from Christmas through to Easter (December - April), however walking the track in autumn can be a good option as there are fewer people on the track and the weather is often calm and settled. Mountain biking is being trialled on the Heaphy Track in the winter season only, 1 May to 30 September, until 2013.

    <h3>
      Travelling with
      children
    </h3>
    <p>
      For those with limited time or families with young children we recommend
      completing a day walk or staying overnight at a hut to experience some of the track
      and spend time exploring. A popular two-day, one-night
      trip starting from the western side of the track is from Kohaihai to
      Heaphy Hut, returning to Kohaihai. The longest of the Great Walks at 78.4 km, to
      walk the whole of the Heaphy Track you will need to be fit and have good equipment.
      We recommend that walkers start a fitness programme at least two months before
      departure and practise carrying a full pack (15 kg) up and down stairs or hills.
      For a 4 day trip you can expect to walk up to 24 km per day or 21 km per day for a
      5 day trip.
