      How to get to the trailhead
    </h3>
    <p>
      The track can be accessed by car or you can arrange shuttle transport through
      a tour operator.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Note: The track is located deep inside Te Urewera National Park, so access to
      the trailhead is at least partially on windy, narrow, and unsealed roads through
      the rainforest. The scenery is beautiful - just don&rsquo;t forget that your drive
      to the trailhead will take considerably longer than on regular roads. Also, note
      that for much of the Te Urewera Rainforest Route there is no cell phone
      reception.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      You can start your walk either from Onepoto or Hopuruahine along the Te
      Urewera Rainforest Route (SH38). Both trailheads can also be accessed by water taxi
      from the Waikaremoana Motor Camp, Aniwaniwa, which has secure car parking and a DOC
      visitor centre close by.
