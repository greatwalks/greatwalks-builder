"Gallon's Sawmill ","The Rakiura track runs past a number of old sawmill sites that once dotted the island's coastline. The first sawmill was built here in 1861 when Gallon dammed the small stream that flows into the head of Kaipipi Inlet to direct water into a race to a waterwheel to power his saw. No structures remain today, but there is still evidence of the rock lined pit where the waterwheel once stood and on-site interpretation tells the story of this mill.
