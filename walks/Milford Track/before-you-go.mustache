    </p>
    
    <ol>

      </li>
      <li>
        Tell someone
      </li>

      </li>

  <h3>Milford
  Track safety</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>
      The track may need to be
      closed for safety reasons (e.g. avalanche danger, flooding or high winds).
      The Fiordland National Park Visitor Centre staff can
      keep you informed of all issues and options around these situations.
    </li>

    <li>
      This track is not
      recommended for children under the age of 10 due to the exposed mountainous
      environment and often adverse weather conditions.
    </li>

    <li>
      During the off-peak
      season (May to October) the track remains open but is subject to weather, track and
      avalanche conditions. Make sure you are fully prepared before you go. DOC rangers
      are not in residence at the huts during the off-peak season.
    </li>

    <li>
      Fiordland National Park
      lies in an area of predominantly westerly airstreams, which deliver high rainfall
      and changeable weather patterns to the area. Cold temperatures, snow, strong winds
      and heavy rain can occur at any time of the year.
    </li>
    <li>Cell phone coverage on the track is limited.</li>
  </ul>

  

  <h3>Things to know
  before you go</h3>
