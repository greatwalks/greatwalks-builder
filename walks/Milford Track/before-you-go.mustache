  <h2>Before you  go</h2>

  <p>It is important to plan
  and prepare so that you are well equipped to enjoy your Great Walk.</p>

  

  <p>Before you go, know The Outdoor Safety Code - 5 simple rules to help you stay
  safe:</p>

  

  <ol class="c21" start="1">
    <li>Plan your trip</li>

    <li>Tell someone</li>

    <li>Be aware of the weather</li>

    <li>Know your limits</li>

    <li>Take sufficient supplies</li>
  </ol>

  <h4><a name="h.xf25ghgdn3f4" id="h.xf25ghgdn3f4"></a>Milford
  Track safety</h4>

  <ol>
    <li>
      The track may need to be
      closed for safety reasons (e.g. avalanche danger, flooding or high winds).
      The Fiordland National Park Visitor Centre staff can
      keep you informed of all issues and options around these situations.
    </li>

    <li>
      This track is not
      recommended for children under the age of 10 due to the exposed mountainous
      environment and often adverse weather conditions.
    </li>

    <li>
      During the off-peak
      season (May to October) the track remains open but is subject to weather, track and
      avalanche conditions. Make sure you are fully prepared before you go. DOC rangers
      are not in residence at the huts during the off-peak season.
    </li>

    <li>
      Fiordland National Park
      lies in an area of predominantly westerly airstreams, which deliver high rainfall
      and changeable weather patterns to the area. Cold temperatures, snow, strong winds
      and heavy rain can occur at any time of the year.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <ol>
    <li>Cell phone coverage on the track is limited.</li>
  </ol>

  

  <h4>Things to know
  before you go</h4>

  <ol>
    <li>
      A good level of fitness
      and the right outdoor clothing and equipment will greatly improve the enjoyment of
      your trip.
    </li>

    <li>
      Safety is your
      responsibility - leave your trip details with a trusted contact. Intention forms
      are available at <a href="http://adventuresmart.org.nz/Outdoors-Intentions/Default.asp">adventuresmart.org.nz</a>.
    </li>

    <li>
      Book your trip well in
      advance including your accommodation, transport and transfers to the start/end of
      the Great Walk.
    </li>

    <li>
      Pack all necessary
      equipment, your own food and drinks and any personal items for your trip including
      an extra day's supply of food and water.
