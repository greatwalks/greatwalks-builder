        <span>Explore an amazing limestone cave! Grab a couple of torches and take a 10
        min stroll from Luxmore Hut to Luxmore Caves. Just 30 metres into the cave

      <span class="c7">1-1.5 hours, 5 km / 3 mi</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span>Head to the wharf at Te Anau downs for a leisurely 1 hour 25 minute cruise
      across the lake to the start of the Milford Track. 1km into your walk, you will
      come across the first and largest of several suspension bridges along the track.
      The well-graded track goes through beautiful beach forest and along the banks of
      the Clinton River. A short 10 minute side track just before the Clinton Hut, leads
      to a wetland area. There are great swimming holes near the hut.</span>

    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span>Following the Clinton River, you gradually climb towards its source Lake
      Mintaro at the base of Mackinnon Pass. Admire the lush forest as you head towards
      Clinton Forks &ndash; a prime spot for seeing the endangered whio (blue duck). Past
      the Hirere Falls, you get a first view of the Mackinnon Pass and the impressive
      Pompolona ice field. From here, you can take in the sheer scale of the rock walls
      towering above and notice the vegetation change as you reach higher
      altitudes.</span>

    <p class="c4">
      <span>A zigzag climb leads to Mackinnon Pass and the memorial to Quintin Mackinnon
      which has inspiring views of Lake Mintaro and the Clinton Canyon. The track from
      here drops steadily, through an alpine garden and several waterfalls before
      arriving at the Bus Stop Shelter at Marlene&rsquo;s Creek and the Sutherland Falls
      side track. Here you can opt to leave your pack at the shelter and take the track
      up to the magnificent Sutherland Falls, the highest in New Zealand. Allow an extra
      1.5 hours walk time return.</span>

      <span>Follow the Arthur River to the historic boatshed, the impressive Mackay Falls
      and intriguing Bell Rock. Admire the rock cuttings alongside the Arthur River and
      Lake Ada, which were blasted and hand cut by contracted labourers. The final 3 km
      of the walk is an enjoyable, smooth, wide track constructed by a prison labour gang
      in the early 1890s. Pass the Giant Gate Falls before you take the short boat ride
      back to Te Anau.</span>
