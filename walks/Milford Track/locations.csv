"Lake Ada","Toward the end of the 19th century many visitors were walking the new track and there was an increasing demand to upgrade. Modelling an experiment from England, the Inspector General of Prisons decided to take 45 prisoners to work on cutting a road from Sandfly Point to Sutherland Falls. In 1892, prison barracks were set up at Sandfly Point. Within days of their arrival two prisoners escaped and fled over the track, only to be met by police in Te Anau. The next year two more escaped and got all the way to Mossburn, before being recaptured.
Due to a lack of discipline and only two kilometres of road being completed in nearly two years, it was decided the prisoners be removed and replaced with contract labourers. With most of the new labour gang being ex-miners and experienced with explosives, they were able to complete the difficult rock-blasting around Lake Ada by 1898. The names of two of the gang can still be seen carved on a rock wall there.","Historic site","167.864965","-44.70303203"
