    <h3>
      When to go
    </h3>
    <p>
      The track is open all year and is most popular during the peak season
      (October to April) when the weather is warmer and daylight hours are longer.
      Transport, activity, equipment and accommodation operators are available year
      round. Walking the track during the winter months (June - August) also has its
      advantages with fewer visitors, calmer water, hardly any insects and less water
      traffic.

    </h3>
    <p>
      The Abel Tasman Coast Track is accessible by road at four points, each with a
      carpark:
    </p>
    <ol class="c12" start="1">
      <li>
        Marahau, the southern gateway, is 67 km / 41 mi from Nelson on sealed
        road.
      </li>
      <li>
        Wainui is 21 km / 13 mi from Takaka. For the last 2 km / 1 mi, the road is
        unsealed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Totaranui is 32 km / 19 mi from Takaka. For the last 12 km / 7 mi, the road
        is unsealed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Awaroa estuary is 31 km / 19 mi from Takaka. The last 12 km / 7 mi of road
        is rough and unsealed. There are two fords, which flood after heavy rain. From
        the Awaroa carpark on the northern side of the estuary, it&rsquo;s 25 minutes of
        tidal walk to Awaroa hut and campsite, which are on the southern side of the
        estuary.
      </li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>
      The track is well serviced by public transport including buses/coaches and
      boat transport.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Bus services operate in summer from Nelson and Motueka to the major road ends
      at Marahau and Kaiteriteri, and connect with Takaka transport to Totaranui and
      Wainui. Bookings are recommended. In winter, bus services operate daily to Marahau
      and Kaiteriteri but not so regularly to Wainui and Totaranui.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Water taxis operate year round from Marahau and Kaiteriteri. The scheduled
      water taxi pick up locations are: Anchorage, Torrent Bay, Bark Bay, Onetahuti,
      Awaroa and Totaranui.

      beech forest with large k&#257;nuka trees. After Yellow Point the track turns
      inland, winding in and out of several little gullies before emerging in open
      country that overlooks beautiful Torrent Bay. Descend to Anchorage Hut and
      Campsite.

      From Anchorage, cross a low ridge to Torrent Bay estuary. The estuary can be
      crossed within two hours either side of low tide or an all-tide track leads around
      it to Torrent Bay. At the northern end of Torrent Bay beach the track climbs
      steadily and then sidles around two valleys to Falls River, which is crossed by a
      47 m suspension bridge. Beyond the river, the track meanders through lush coastal
      forest before leading back to the sea. Follow the track to the hut and campsite
      beside Bark Bay estuary.

      Cross Bark Bay estuary or follow the all-tide track (10 minutes) around the

      m&#257;nuka. Return to the shore at Tonga Quarry with a short walk to Onetahuti
      Bay. The tidal stream can be crossed within 3 hours either side of low tide. The
      track then climbs over Tonga Saddle and descends to Awaroa Inlet. Follow the shore
      to Awaroa Hut and Campsite.

      Awaroa Inlet can only be crossed up to one and a half hours before low tide

      Waiharakeke Bay before re-entering the forest and emerging at Goat Bay. Climb
       to a lookout above Skinner Point before descending to  the Totaranui
      Campsite. The track heads around Totaranui estuary, climbs over a low saddle and
      winds through lush forest to Anapai Bay. From here to Mutton Cove the scenery
      alternates between sandy beaches and rocky headlands of regenerating k&#257;nuka
      trees. Descend to Whariwharangi Bay, the hut and campsite are just behind the
