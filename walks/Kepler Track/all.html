  <h1>Kepler Track</h1>

  <p class="c0"><span>A real adventure above the clouds, from the gentle, beech-forested
  shores of lakes Te Anau and Manapouri to the tussocky alpine tops and grand Mt Luxmore.
  On top of the world, you&rsquo;ll be rewarded with marvellous panoramic views of the
  Kepler Mountains on one side, and lakes, rivers and valleys on the other.</span></p>

    <li class="c4 c0"><span>Explore an amazing limestone cave! Grab a couple of torches
    and take a 10 min stroll from Luxmore Hut to Luxmore Caves. Just 30 metres into the
    cave you&rsquo;ll find stalactites and stalagmites.</span></li>

    <li class="c4 c0"><span>Swing bridges make for an entertaining journey over rivers
    and creeks. The Rainbow Reach swing bridge crosses the Waiau River and is an
    impressive entry/exit point for the track.</span></li>

    <li class="c4 c0"><span>Take a 15 min stroll from Iris Burn Hut to Iris Burn Falls.
    The falls are a great place for an icy cold swim to refresh you after a day&rsquo;s
    walking!</span></li>

    <li class="c4 c0"><span>Watching the sunrise from Luxmore Hut allows you to take in
    splendid views of Lake Te Anau right across to the Murchison Mountains.</span></li>

    <li class="c4 c0"><span>Listen out for the call of NZ&rsquo;s iconic kiwi from Iris
    Burn Hut. Fiordland Kiwi/Tokoeka can be heard on the Kepler Track. Largely nocturnal,
    it cannot fly, has loose, hair-like feathers and long whiskers.</span></li>

  description</span></h3>

  <p class="c0"><span>The Kepler Track is a circular track that begins and ends at the
  Kepler Track carpark at the southern end of Lake Te Anau, about 5 km from Te Anau
  township. This well-graded track can be walked in either direction.</span></p>

  <p class="c3 c0"></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>Access is either by road or a 50 minute walk from the Fiordland
  National Park Visitor Centre. Alternatively, there is an entry point at Rainbow Reach,
  a 10 minute (12 km) drive from Te Anau.</span></p>

  <p class="c3 c0"></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>Shuttle buses provide a daily service to entry and exit points on
  the track during the Great Walks season (late October to late April). A scheduled boat
  service also offers transport to Brod Bay.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>It is recommended that the track is walked in an anti-clockwise
  direction, allowing a more gradual climb of 1000m through cool beech forest to the bush
  line. Note the altitude level when you view the elevation profile.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c7">Day 1: Kepler Track car park to Luxmore Hut</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c7">5-6 hours, 13.8 km / 8 mi</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>Walk alongside the lake shore through a forest of mountain and red
  beech, a grove of hard tree ferns and crown fern. Continue through to Coal Creek Bridge
  to arrive at Brod Bay which is a great spot for swimming.</span><span class=
  "c7">&nbsp;</span><span>Climbing steadily for two hours, the track will lead you to
  limestone bluffs and a great place to lunch. Another hour&rsquo;s walking will reward
  you with panoramic views of the Te Anau Basin and the Takitimu, Snowden and Earl
  Mountains.</span></p>

  <p class="c3 c0"></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c7">Luxmore Hut to Iris Burn Hut</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c7">5-6 hours, 14.6 km / 9 mi</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>In heavy rain, strong winds or wintry weather wait at Luxmore Hut
  until the weather improves. From the hut, a gradual climb will take you to a ridge
  below the summit of Mount Luxmore and a side track walk of 10 minutes will take you to
  the 1472 m summit. After a climb over ridges for about 2 hours, the track starts to
  wind down through beautiful forest. A 20 minute walk from the Iris Burn Hut will lead
  you to Iris Burns Waterfall.</span></p>

  <p class="c3 c0"></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c7">Iris Burn Hut to Moturau Hut</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c7">5-6 hours, 16.2 km / 10 mi</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>Walk through beech forest and a gorge, climb over a low saddle and
  wander through another mixed species forest on your way to a large natural landslide,
  which was caused by excessive rain in 1984. As you near Lake Manapouri a left turn
  takes you through lowland beech and a podocarp forest through to Moturau Hut which is
  situated beside a beautiful beach.</span></p>

  <p class="c3 c0"></p>

  <p class="c3 c0"></p>

  <p class="c3 c0"></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c7">Moturau Hut to Kepler Track car park</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c7">4-5 hours, 15.5 km / 9 mi</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span>A moderate walk will take you through a beech forest across
  wetland, follows the Waiau River Terrace to the swing bridge at Rainbow Reach. Follow
  the final part of the Kepler Track through a variety of forest and river views through
  to the Kepler Track car park. Along here are great opportunities for trout
  fishing!</span></p>
