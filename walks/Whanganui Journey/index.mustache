      The Whanganui River winds its way from the mountains to the Tasman Sea
      through countless hills and valleys. This journey takes you on a multi-day canoe or
      kayak trip to experience its most remote scenic beauty, history and cultural
      significance <a href="#" class="icon icon-culture" data-content="Learn about the intimate connection the Whanganui iwi share with their awa (river) and imagine the times when traditional waka (canoe) and steam-driven riverboats plied the river.<br>Early M&#257;ori cultivated the sheltered terraces and built elaborate eel weirs along river channels where eels and lamprey were known to converge. Every bend of the river had kaitiaki (guardian) which controlled the mauri (life force) of that place. The mana (prestige) of a settlement depended upon the way in which food supplies and living areas were looked after for the benefit of the tribe."></a>.
