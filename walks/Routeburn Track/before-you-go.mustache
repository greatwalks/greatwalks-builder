          The track may need to be
          closed for safety reasons (e.g. avalanche danger, flooding or high winds).

      <li>
        
          This track is not
          recommended for children under the age of 10 due to the exposed mountainous
          environment and often adverse weather conditions. However, an overnight stay at
          Routeburn Flats, Routeburn Falls or Lake Howden huts is a great way for a
          family to experience part of the track.
        
      </li>
      <li>
        
          During the off-peak
          season (May - October) the track remains open but is subject to weather, track
          and avalanche conditions. Make sure you are fully prepared before you go. There
          are no DOC rangers in residence during the off-peak season.

    <h4>
      When to go
    </h4>
    <p>
      The best time to walk the Routeburn Track is during the Great Walks season
      from late October to late April when the weather is warmer and there are more
      regular transport services to and from the start and end of the track. During the
      off-peak season (May to October) the Routeburn Track remains open but is subject to
      weather, track and avalanche conditions.

      The Routeburn Track is the perfect track for you, and your family and
      friends, if you love being amongst nature and want an exciting outdoors adventure
      on a track with excellent facilities. It also offers fantastic day walk
      opportunities for families or those with less time. However, the track is not
      recommended for children under the age of 10 due to the exposed mountainous
      environment and often adverse weather conditions. An excellent option for families
      keen to experience part of the track is an overnight stay at Routeburn Flats Hut,
      Routeburn Falls Hut or Lake Howden Hut.
