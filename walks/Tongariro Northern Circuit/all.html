      <span>The Tongariro Northern Circuit starts and finishes at Whakapapa Village,

      normally you start at Mangatepopo, as the altitude (1120 m) is higher than at
      Ketetahi (760 m) so there is less climbing involved. Shuttle buses operate for
      walking in this direction, with services to Mangatepopo in the morning and back
      from Ketetahi in the afternoon. Allow an extra hour to walk the track in reverse
      from Ketetahi to Mangatepopo.</span>
