      Travelling with
      children
    </h3>
    <p>
      The circuit is a moderately challenging hike, mostly on open and exposed
      volcanic terrain and is not recommended for children under the age of 10. However,
      there are a range of shorter walking opportunities, suitable for the whole family
      and for those with less time available. You can do a walk of a few hours or a whole
      day, or an overnight stay in one of the huts or campsites.
